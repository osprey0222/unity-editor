# Unity Editor 

## Introduction

Improve usability and clarity of key features in Unity Editor for better workflow!

This Toolbox not only extends functionalities, it does so with the user in mind.
Written to be as flexible and optimized as possible. Now you and other programming professionals will be able to create a readable and useful component editor simply by using attributes. You’ll get fast and clear access to data from GameObjects placed in the Scene. Lastly, you’ll gain more control over the Project window. Go ahead, customize those folder icons.

It's worth to mention that prepared drawers are based on the custom, layout-based system. Additionally, I’m leaving you some useful scripts, classes, and functions that facilitate Editor extensions development.
